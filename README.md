## What are the challenges i faced for the backend:
+ #### First thing i am using mongoose first time. So it was little uncomfortable for me.But this isn't being a problem for long time.After some routes make i am now confident about it.
+ #### I have face deploy related issue for backend.When i try to deploy it on vercel first noting show in my vercel host url.Then i find the solution after some research.
+ #### For the first time i make so many folder for backend. Before that i used to do all the things in index.js . So, primarily i was so confused about importing and exporting things but now i am okay with that.
